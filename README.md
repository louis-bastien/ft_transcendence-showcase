🔒 *Private repository — team project at 42 School*

A multiplayer Pong web app built as a full-stack team project during the 42 engineering program. Developed with Django, JavaScript, and Docker, and deployed to a live AWS EC2 instance under a custom domain.

#### 🧠 My Contributions
- Handled **full deployment pipeline**: EC2 provisioning, domain registration, DNS setup, and S3 integration for persistent storage  
- Set up **CI/CD pipeline** using GitHub Actions for automated builds and deployments  
- Led the **cybersecurity module**: implemented HashiCorp Vault for secret management and configured a WAF using ModSecurity with the OWASP Core Rule Set  
- Dockerized the full stack for both development and production using Docker Compose  
- Implemented **monitoring** with Prometheus and Grafana, including exporters, alerting rules, and custom dashboards  
- Contributed to frontend styling and added **language switch support** using Python i18n libraries
